# UCI HAR Dataset Readme File #

The HAR (Human Activity Recognition) database is based on recordings from 30 subjects as they performed activities of daily living (ADL). Subjects carried a waist-mounted smart phone with embedded inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). The study collected 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. Both were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.

Data in our cleaned data set includes only the mean and standard deviation variables from the original data set. 

The following files are included:

* 'README.md'
* 'Codebook.md': Shows information about variables, data and cleaning process. 
* 'run_analysis.R': R script that produces 'tidy.data.txt'. 
* 'tidy.data.txt': Table of variable means by subject and activity.
